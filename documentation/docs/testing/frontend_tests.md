# AE - Frontend Testing

Currently, no testing is in place. As per the project outline, this is simply a demonstration and thus I did not implement full end-to-end (E2E), user-interface, or unit-testing for the frontend.

## Ideal Frameworks
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) > Snapshot Testing
- [React Testing Libray](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) > Unit Testing
- [MSW](https://www.npmjs.com/package/msw) > Mocking API Calls
- [Cyprus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cypress) > E2E Testing
